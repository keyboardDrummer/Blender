There's an infinite amount of work to be done for Blender, so contributions are very welcome. There are many different topics to work on, some suitable for a Bachelor's or Master's thesis.

Some examples of cool features:

- Parser combinators that allow defining indentation sensitive grammars, such as those of Python and Haskell.
- A DSL for static semantics, such as name binding and type checking. See the paper [A constraint language for static semantic analysis based on scope graphs](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2850000/2847543/p49-antwerpen.pdf?ip=145.129.111.38&id=2847543&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E77FCF3B2F09622E1&CFID=992904318&CFTOKEN=51306518&__acm__=1507451717_5c1e5970ab3ac31fbd9849edb486a802) for inspiration
- Error correcting parsing
- Generating syntactic code completion from a grammar, as in the paper [Principled syntactic code completion using placeholders](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3000000/2997374/p163-amorim.pdf?ip=145.129.111.38&id=2997374&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E77FCF3B2F09622E1&CFID=992904318&CFTOKEN=51306518&__acm__=1507451951_eb454d2173854f174d05e3c1e1526bbd)
- Incremental compilation: incremental parsing, incremental type checking, etc.
- Add a new language front-end or back-end.

#### How to contribute
1. Reach out on [the Gitter](https://gitter.im/LanguageBlender/Lobby), so other contributors can help you out where the documentation is lacking.
1. Look through the open issues to see if you find something interesting
1. Enjoy the work ;-)
1. Once you're done, submit a pull request and make sure the build server approves it.
