Building Blender is as simple as:

1. Grab [the source](https://github.com/keyboardDrummer/Blender) from GitHub.
1. Make sure you have installed the Java 8 JDK, or a higher version. To check what version you have installed, open the terminal and type:

   `javac -version`

   If you don't have it installed, download the JDK <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>.
1. Install <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a>
1. Call 'sbt run' in the project root to build Blender and start the sandbox desktop application.

> Add option to download IntelliJ and open Blender in that.
