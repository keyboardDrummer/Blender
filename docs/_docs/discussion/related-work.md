Blender is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/"), which serves as a host language for its embedded metalanguages. Some workbenches like [Rascal](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal") define stand-alone metalanguages with general purpose programming facilities. This provides a smooth experience when using the language, but leaves you without the ecosystem of a popular language. Other workbenches like [Spoofax](http://metaborg.org/en/latest/) and [MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) define metalanguages optimized for usability, leaving out generic programming facilities. While these languages are user-friendly, they are not suitable for being transformed.
