Blender can be run as a desktop application, which provides a sandbox for constructing languages from the Delta's defined beforehand. Here is a screenshot of the workbench panel:

To get an overview of the different delta's in Blender and how they relate, you can view the dependency graph. Here is a screenshot showing part of the graph:

Once you've composed a language from a set of Delta's you can play around with it in the language playground. Here you can write programs in the language supported by language specific tooling, compile those programs and pretty print the target language, run those programs, determine which compilation phases the language's compiler has, and inspect the language's in- and output grammar.
